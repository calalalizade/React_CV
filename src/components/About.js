                Big Smoke was a high-ranking member of the Grove Street Families who later defected to the Ballas, and made clandestine deals with the Los Santos Vagos and Russian Mafia, eventually becoming the most powerful crook in the criminal underworld of Los Santos.
                Big Smoke makes multiple references to his desire to be remembered after his death.
                Big Smoke appears to speak some Spanish, as seen in the mission Running Dog. He tries to get weed from some Vagos members and after being cursed at, he threatens one of the Vagos members who then responds with "Chinga a tu madre, pendejo" which roughly translates into "Fuck your mother, asshole".

                At first, Big Smoke appeared to be a good and loyal friend of CJ. Unlike Ryder and Sweet who constantly berate Carl for his misdeeds, Big Smoke seemed to be compassionate towards the protagonist, comforting him during the funerals. He was also known to be quite funny and, often, joking with CJ and the other gang members and was almost always in a good mood. However, beneath his exterior, Big Smoke is actually a power-hungry hypocrite.
                Once Tenpenny starts blackmailing him, Big Smoke has no choice but to betray the gang, as he knew what would happen if didn't cooperate with the corrupt officer. although, too, he did it for power and wealth, and indeed incited Ryder to betray the gang, as since he could not do it alone.
